### Usage

![Viewport panel](/images/panel.jpg)

You can activate the selection restrictor from the 3D viewport.

![Activate](/images/restrictor.jpg)

### Preferences
From the preferences you can compose your panel by picking the types of objects to display. This way, you can save some space and keep things tidy.

![Preferences](/images/pref.jpg)

By default, objects whose types are not displayed are still selectable. You can change this behavior by clicking on the funnel icon.

#### Lights
If some emissive objects are part of your lighting setup, you can count them as light. If only some of them are lights while the others are just objects, you can filter them by adding a prefix to their name (i.e. : light_)
