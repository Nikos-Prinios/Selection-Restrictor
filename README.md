# Selection-Restrictor
**This Blender add-on helps to restrict the selection of objects by type**  

Selection-Restrictor (Alesis) and Selectivity (Nikos) have merged into a single project. Luciano joined the team.

### Usage

You can activate the selection restrictor from the 3D viewport.  

![Viewport panel](/images/panel.gif)  

### Preferences
From the preferences you can compose your panel by picking the types of objects to display. This way, you can save some space and keep things tidy.

By default, objects whose types are not displayed are still selectable. You can change this behavior by clicking on the funnel icon.

#### Ctrl-click
Control-click on a button will activate it and deactivate all the others. Or vice-versa. Depends.

#### Lights
If some emissive objects are part of your lighting setup, you can count them as light. If only some of them are lights while the others are just objects, you can filter them by adding a prefix to their name (i.e. : light_)

#### Selected objects only
The last icon turns everything unselectable but your current selection of objects.
